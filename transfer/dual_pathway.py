NOW TRENDIN — DUAL-PATHWAY DETECTION (Phase C recalibration)
================================================================

THE PROBLEM (diagnosed empirically):
  Detection is composed ~60% from G (gradient strength = niche/expert
  engagement ratio) + D (dark matter = expert first-timer asymmetry).
  Both REWARD expert-community origin. Discovery feeds (Wikipedia / Google
  Trends "what the world is searching") are tagged platform_tier
  "mainstream" — so their niche ratio is ~0 and their Detection is floored,
  no matter how large the real attention. Result: a fragmented news n-gram
  ("iran announce deal") that recurs across niche/expert news feeds scored
  47 / flagged ANOMALY, while "FIFA World Cup" (777K Wikipedia views that
  day) scored 41. The engine measured the niche/mainstream RATIO and threw
  away absolute attention MAGNITUDE entirely.

THE FIX — two legitimate trend archetypes, one Detection number:
  1. EXPERT-ORIGIN (tech): scored by the existing gradient (niche
     concentration = runway ahead). THE MOAT — left completely unchanged
     when a topic is expert-origin (mainstream_ratio ~ 0).
  2. MAINSTREAM-ORIGIN (consumer culture): there is no expert phase — the
     World Cup is mainstream by nature. The honest signal is absolute
     attention MAGNITUDE + breadth + acceleration (data we already collect:
     Wikipedia views, Google Trends traffic), NOT a niche ratio that is
     structurally ~0 and meaningless for it.

  Detection blends the two pathways by how mainstream-origin the topic is:
     w = mainstream_ratio (0 = pure expert, 1 = pure mainstream)
     detection = (1-w) * expert_detection + w * mainstream_detection

  At w~0 expert topics are IDENTICAL to before (moat preserved). At w~1 a
  consumer trend is judged on real magnitude instead of a ~0 gradient.

INTEGRITY:
  Magnitude is REAL attention (log of actual views/traffic the source
  reports) — not fabricated, not circular, not our own users' demand. This
  recalibration changes how EXTERNAL attention is weighed, never invents it.
